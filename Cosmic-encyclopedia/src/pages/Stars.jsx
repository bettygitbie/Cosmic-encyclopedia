        Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one
        septillion stars – that’s a one followed by 24 zeros. Our Milky Way
        alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied
        star, the Sun.
      </p>

        Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and
        small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle,
        ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties
        change as it ages.
