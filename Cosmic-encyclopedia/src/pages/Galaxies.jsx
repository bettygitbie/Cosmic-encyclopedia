      <p>
        Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, all
        bound together by gravity. The largest contain trillions of stars and
        can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can contain
        a few thousand stars and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large
        galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, some with
        billions of times the Sunâ€™s mass.
