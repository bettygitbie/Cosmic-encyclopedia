      <p>
        Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's
        the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
        NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and
        warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.
